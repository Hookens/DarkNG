# DarkNG
**DarkNG is a simple CSS theme that turns the BeamNG website into a more appealing, dark interface.**
Unfortunately, some parts may still be bright due to them containing images.
Consdering the Wiki is getting reworked, the theme isn't compatible with it. It is compatible with the documentation however.
